# __Replicated Coding Challenge Submission__

## __Why Python?__
 
After correctly setting up Docker, my initial plan was to get up to speed on Golang, Ginkgo and Gomega - and complete the assignment accordingly.

I went through the resources provided as well as additional sites trying to learn the correct syntax and structure for the testing tools. 

**Ultimately, after some time spent not being able to get the markdown and membership tests to work, I felt that learning a new language and testing framework was pulling me away from the core objectives of this exercise:**  

* Correctness: Do your tests compile and run? Do they actually make calls to the API and verify results?

* Code Quality: Is your code maintainable, easy to understand, and conducive for future reuse or expansion?
Quality Focused: Does your choice of test case scenarios provide adequate, given the limits, confidence in the quality of the GitHub API endpoints tested?

* Communication: Are you able to defend why you picked your test case scenarios and explain what they do in your README and through other forms of communication?

I have added a directory with Python functions calling various Github endpoints and the associated tests.  Also included is a requirements file and a README.  



## __RUNNING THE FILE__

Install the dependencies:

``python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the tests:
``python
python githubapi_tests.py
```
